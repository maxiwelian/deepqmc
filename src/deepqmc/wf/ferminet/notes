wf.mo.init_from_pyscf(mf, freeze_mos=freeze_mos)  # CREATE THE HF ORBITALS
## DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PYSCF


What function extracts the hf orbitals from pyscf?

what does the sloglindet do?

what should I pass to it?

what is conf coeff?

how to get r_atoms out of mol?

What other attributes does the WaveFunction need to train?

What does , *, argument do?
